# Word Search Captcha!
A word search puzzle captcha created for the Kitboga code jam 2025.
## Overview
This captcha requires solving a word search that takes on the appearance of traditional text-based captchas. The puzzle is procedurally generated by implementing the word search construction algorithm outlined in this [paper](https://ijses.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/68-IJSES-V6N1.pdf).

## Features
This puzzle is configurable to tune difficulty as needed. You can adjust the dimensions of the grid, the directions the words can be placed, and the number of words to place. All placed words must be found in order to complete the puzzle. Placed words are selected randomly from an array of strings located in a dedicated file. Additionally, if enabled, the game will restart after a specified number of incorrect words have been selected, generating a new puzzle to solve. 

Noise textures and a displacement effect can be toggled to give the appearance of a traditional captcha. A displacement map is generated upon initialization, and it's strength is configurable by adjusting the displacement scale.

Selecting letters draws a stroke on canvas elements underneath. The radius of this stroke as well as the font size of the letters in the grid are proportional to the side length of a single square grid cell. When experimenting with different fonts or adjusting the dimensions of the grid, these can be changed as necessary. 

Depending on the relative aspect ratios of the game container and the puzzle dimensions, the puzzle will expand to fill the container with letter-box or pillar-box styling.
